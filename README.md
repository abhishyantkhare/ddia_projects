## README

Decided to try and implement main ideas, data structures, and algorithms in Designing Data Intensive Applications in C. I wanted to get more of an in depth understanding of these concepts, so I'm trying to implement them myself. Decided to do it in C so I can also simultaneously refresh C and my understanding of computer internals. Also because I hate myself and that's why I chose C.
